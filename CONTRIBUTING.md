### Adding SVG Images
### Adding Background Images
- Navigate to https://undraw.co/illustrations 
- In the top right hand corner, there is a colour box drop down. Open this drop down and change the colour sceme to #135EF2. This is also labled as the primary colour in the variables.scss under stylesheets. 
- Now you can search and explore the images before downloading as an SVG and adding to the project.
